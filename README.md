Mobile app developed for the UNIMI computer science exam Mobile Computing

# App Description

This app in java for Android was created specifically for Professor Mascetti's Mobile Computing exam at the University of Milan. 
The project consisted of creating an app with a map. In this map, one's own location was shown and, in a 100m surrounding, the location of some objects and other users who enabled location sharing. 
The objects could be, monsters, armor, swords, candy or amulets.
Monsters can be fought and the life that will be lost can be between the level of the monster and the level of the monster*2. Candy heals life while amulets expand the initial 100-meter radius so that more objects can be seen in the map. 
The user starts with 100 life points and if he dies the life is automatically restored. 
Each user is able to choose to share their location. If he shares the location it will be shown on the map. 
The user can also change his username and profile picture, which must be less than 100kb.
